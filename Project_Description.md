The Problem:
I am someone who cannot really understand relationships between different features of a star, and I am not sure if others who aren't in this particular field can. So, I started looking for different connections in stars. While I was looking through the data to find any relationships in the data, I realized that there was a significant relationship between the luminosity and the absolute visual magnitude. I realized that for the really low luminosities, the magnitude was quite high, but for the really high luminosities, the magnitude was low. 

My solution:
With the problem in mind, I decided to create a graph to showcase the relationship/correllation between the luminosity of a star and its absolute visual magnitude.

My approach:
I first created a Data Frame from the file. Then, I split it up into two arrays. One represented all the luminosities, while the other represented all the absolute magnitudes. Next, I created a pyplot and put the data into the model/graph. Then, I gave the graph and the axes titles, and I scaled the axes so they fit neatly and well. Finally, I realized the stars with really low luminosities (respectively) were all clumped together at the top, which did not let me see the relationship as accurately. Therefore, I  created a second graph in the same method that just showed the stars that were in a very tiny luminosity range, and that almost worked as a zoom in feature to see the relationship for the dimmer stars too. I realized that as the luminosity increased, the absolute magnitude decreased in a rather exponential manner.
